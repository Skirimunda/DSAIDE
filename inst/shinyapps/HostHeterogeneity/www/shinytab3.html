<h2>What to do</h2>&#13;
<div id="task-1" class="section level3">&#13;
<h3>Task 1:</h3>&#13;
<p>Set the model parameters such that it corresponds to the following setting:</p>&#13;
<pre><code>* 1000 susceptible hosts and 1 infected host of type 1.&#13;
* 200 susceptible hosts and 1 infected host of type 2. &#13;
* Simulation duration approximately 5 years.&#13;
* Assume that transmission from host 1 to host 1 is _b~11~ = 0.002_, from host 2 to host 2 is _b~22~ = 0.01_. No transmission from one host type to the other _b~12~ = 0_ and _b~21~ = 0_.&#13;
* Assume that the duration of the infectious period is 1 month long for both types ( _g~1~_ and _g~2~_ ). &#13;
* No waning immunity.</code></pre>&#13;
<p>With parameters set to correspond to the scenario described, run the simulation and ensure you get outbreaks in both populations with 20% susceptibles left at the end.</p>&#13;
</div>&#13;
<div id="task-2" class="section level3">&#13;
<h3>Task 2:</h3>&#13;
<ul><li>Set <em>b<sub>11</sub> = 0.001</em>. Rest as before. Run the simulation.</li>&#13;
<li>Now set the transmission rate from host 2 to host 1 <em>b<sub>21</sub> = 0.001</em>. You should see an outbreak in both populations. This is an example of a core group driving the dynamics. Contemplate what the core group does.</li>&#13;
</ul></div>&#13;
<div id="task-3" class="section level3">&#13;
<h3>Task 3:</h3>&#13;
<ul><li>Keep all settings as before, but set initial number of infected type 1 hosts to 0.</li>&#13;
<li>Contemplate what you expect to see, run the simulation, see if your expectations are confirmed.</li>&#13;
<li>Now set the initial number of infected type 1 hosts back to 1, and infected type 2 hosts to 0.</li>&#13;
<li>Contemplate what you expect to see, run the simulation, see if your expectations are confirmed.</li>&#13;
</ul></div>&#13;
<div id="task-4" class="section level3">&#13;
<h3>Task 4:</h3>&#13;
<ul><li>Set the transmission rate from host 1 to host 1 and from host 2 to host 2 to 0.</li>&#13;
<li>Set the transmission rate from host 2 to host 1 to 0.01, from host 1 to host 2 to 0.002. Those are the same values used in task 1 for transmission among the same hosts.</li>&#13;
<li>Set <em>I1<sub>0</sub> = 1</em> and <em>I2<sub>0</sub> = 1</em>.</li>&#13;
<li>Contemplate what you expect to see, run the simulation, see if your expectations are confirmed.</li>&#13;
<li>Now set the transmission rate <em>b<sub>12</sub> = 0.01</em>, and <em>b<sub>21</sub> = 0.002</em>. Again, think about your expectations, run simulation and check.</li>&#13;
</ul></div>&#13;
<div id="task-5" class="section level3">&#13;
<h3>Task 5:</h3>&#13;
<ul><li>Repeat the previous task, with only an infected of type 1 initially present.</li>&#13;
<li>Contemplate what you expect to see, run the simulation, see if your expectations are confirmed.</li>&#13;
</ul></div>&#13;
<div id="task-6" class="section level3">&#13;
<h3>Task 6:</h3>&#13;
<ul><li>Repeat the previous task, with only an infected of type 2 initially present.</li>&#13;
<li>Contemplate what you expect to see, run the simulation, see if your expectations are confirmed.</li>&#13;
</ul></div>&#13;
<div id="task-7" class="section level3">&#13;
<h3>Task 7:</h3>&#13;
<ul><li>Set everything as in task 1, but with waning immunity <em>w<sub>1</sub> = w<sub>2</sub> = 0.2</em> .</li>&#13;
<li>Run simulation, confirm that both populations reach a steady endemic state.</li>&#13;
<li>Set transmission rate <em>b<sub>21</sub> = 0.005</em>, run the simulation and see what changes.</li>&#13;
<li>Set transmission rate <em>b<sub>12</sub> = 0.005</em>, and <em>b<sub>21</sub> = 0</em>. Run the simulation and see what changes.</li>&#13;
</ul></div>&#13;
<div id="task-8" class="section level3">&#13;
<h3>Task 8:</h3>&#13;
<ul><li>With the settings you just had, turn off waning immunity for type 1, run the simulation and see what you get.</li>&#13;
<li>Turn waning immunity for type 1 back on and turn off for type 2, run the simulation and see what you get.</li>&#13;
</ul></div>&#13;
<div id="task-9" class="section level3">&#13;
<h3>Task 9:</h3>&#13;
<ul><li>Keep exploring. Think of a real ID where accounting for 2 types of hosts is important, see if you can use the simulation to approximate and explore that ID.</li>&#13;
</ul></div>&#13;
