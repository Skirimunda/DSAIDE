<h2>What to do</h2>&#13;
<div id="task-1" class="section level3">&#13;
<h3>Task 1:</h3>&#13;
<ul><li>Set the simulation with a population size of 1000, gamma=50, beta=0.1.</li>&#13;
<li>Use the fraction of susceptible hosts left at the end of the outbreak and the formula given earlier in this module to compute the reproductive number.</li>&#13;
</ul></div>&#13;
<div id="task-2" class="section level3">&#13;
<h3>Task 2:</h3>&#13;
<p>Compare the value for the reproductive number from the simulation with the value you get by directly using the value of the model parameters and the equation for R0.</p>&#13;
</div>&#13;
<div id="task-3" class="section level3">&#13;
<h3>Task 3:</h3>&#13;
<ul><li>Double the value of beta. Before you run the simulation, what do you expect to see and what do you expect to get for R0?</li>&#13;
<li>Run the simulation and compute <span class="math inline">\(R_0\)</span> using the final outbreak size to test your expectations.</li>&#13;
</ul></div>&#13;
<div id="task-3-1" class="section level3">&#13;
<h3>Task 3:</h3>&#13;
<ul><li>Now, double the rate of recovery. Think about your expectations for <span class="math inline">\(R_0\)</span> and the dynamics.</li>&#13;
<li>Run the simulation to check your expectations. Use the final outbreak size to compute <span class="math inline">\(R_0\)</span>.</li>&#13;
</ul></div>&#13;
<div id="task-4" class="section level3">&#13;
<h3>Task 4:</h3>&#13;
<p>Another way to estimate R0 is to determine the rate of increase in infected hosts at the beginning of the outbreak. During the initial phase, new infections increase exponentially according to <span class="math inline">\(I(t)=I_0 e^{r*t}\)</span>. Usually, for any real outbreak, you do not know I0. You can still estimate r by obtaining two values of I(t) at two time points during that initial growth rate and use it to compute the exponential growth rate r. Figure out how to do that. For this model, the growth rate and R0 are related through <span class="math inline">\(R_0 = 1+rD\)</span>, where D is the infectious duration. Use this to determine <span class="math inline">\(R_0\)</span>. You should get essentially the same answer as above.</p>&#13;
</div>&#13;
<div id="task-5" class="section level3">&#13;
<h3>Task 5:</h3>&#13;
<p>What is the value of R at the time the outbreak peaks? (It’s only called R0 at the beginning for a fully susceptible population, when we talk about it more generally, I’ll call it just R). Explain how you can find that value for R, both using intuitive reasoning and using the equation for R0 given above (R0 = 1+r*D). Note that at this R value, the outbreak wanes, but people still get infected. What R value would you need to completely halt any further infections?</p>&#13;
</div>&#13;
<div id="task-6" class="section level3">&#13;
<h3>Task 6:</h3>&#13;
<p>What would happen if a new ID came along that had an R0 value that was the same as the one you just computed in the previous question (the one at the peak of an outbreak)? Test this with the simulation. Choose parameter values for which you get the right R0 and report what you observe.</p>&#13;
</div>&#13;
<div id="task-7" class="section level3">&#13;
<h3>Task 7:</h3>&#13;
<p>So far, we looked at an individual outbreak. Now we introduce births and deaths. For our model, we use a constant birth rate <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span>, and a fixed per-capita death rate <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>. It is possible to have population dynamics (births, deaths) in the absence of an ID. It is useful to first figure out what’s going on there before you introduce the disease dynamics. Choose values for the birthrate and lifespan, run the model and see what the population does in the absence of an infectious disease. Can you figure out the equation that relates births, deaths and steady state level for the population? Specifically, if you have <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> births per year, and a person lives on average Y years, can you find an equation that predicts how many people you will eventually have in your population if you run the model long enough? Test it with the model (or use the model to try and figure out the equation). You will also have to increase the simulation time (and maybe increase the time at which results are returned to speed up things) to see the results.</p>&#13;
</div>&#13;
<div id="task-8" class="section level3">&#13;
<h3>Task 8:</h3>&#13;
<p>If births (and deaths) are present, you will be able to get multiple outbreaks and endemic states. Set the parameter values such that your hosts have an average life-span of 50 years, set birth rate such that the population is steady at 1000 in the absence of the ID. Everything else should be as in #1. Run the simulation long enough to reach a steady state, and record the number of susceptibles/infectious/recovered. Derive analytic expressions for the steady state values for S, I, R. Compare the values from the simulation with those predicted from the steady state equations.</p>&#13;
</div>&#13;
<div id="task-9" class="section level3">&#13;
<h3>Task 9:</h3>&#13;
<p>Use the fraction of susceptibles remaining at steady state to compute R0 as described in the lecture notes. Double the value of gamma, run the simulation again and again compute R0 using the steady state result. Next double the values for both births and death rates and repeat.</p>&#13;
</div>&#13;
<div id="task-10" class="section level3">&#13;
<h3>Task 10:</h3>&#13;
<p>R0 quantifies the level of transmissibility of an ID, which determines how many people will become infected or what level of intervention is needed to stop/prevent an outbreak. However, it is important to be aware that R0 says nothing about the timing/dynamics of the outbreak. Choose some parameter values that produce an outbreak (turn off natural births/deaths for that). Then set the infectious duration 4 times as large (rate reduced by factor of 4) and adjust infectiousness-level (gamma) to get the same R0 as before. Run again and compare the results.</p>&#13;
</div>&#13;
<div id="task-11" class="section level3">&#13;
<h3>Task 11:</h3>&#13;
<p>Usually one gets R0 from the data/literature and uses it to pick values for the transmission parameter beta. Let’s try that. Go online and find values for the duration of the infectious period and for R0 for SARS, use those values in your simulation, and use them to also compute beta. You can leave the population size at 1000. Run an outbreak, see if things match.</p>&#13;
</div>&#13;
<div id="task-12" class="section level3">&#13;
<h3>Task 12:</h3>&#13;
<p>Knowing R is important for control strategies, e.g. for vaccine campaigns.You learned at what value of R an outbreak switches from growth to decline (often called the threshold value) and that for this R value, outbreaks don’t take off. Let’s say you have an ID that enters a new population where everyone is susceptible. That ID has an R0/R=4. Would you expect to see an outbreak? Why? Now let’s assume that we protected half the population through a vaccine. What is the new value for R, i.e. how many people are being infected on average by an infected person after we vaccinated? Is that new value of R low enough to prevent the outbreak? How low does R need to be to prevent an outbreak? What fraction of the population would you need to protect/vaccinate to achieve such an R?</p>&#13;
</div>&#13;
<div id="task-13" class="section level3">&#13;
<h3>Task 13:</h3>&#13;
<p>Let’s test the vaccination idea with the computer simulation. Edit the code such that you can allow for a fraction of the susceptibles to be vaccinated before you run the. You could write a loop over different vaccination levels, or just set the vaccination fraction f by hand and run once. After you have done that, set parameters to get an R0=4, run the simulation for 0% vaccination coverage to confirm things happen as you expect (check if the final size of the susceptible/infected population is what it should be). Then repeat for 50% vaccination coverage (check what R you get and if it’s what you expect) and for the level you determined above to be enough to prevent an outbreak. Also check what R is at that level.</p>&#13;
</div>&#13;
<div id="task-14" class="section level3">&#13;
<h3>Task 14:</h3>&#13;
<p>If births (and deaths) are present, you will be able to get multiple outbreaks and endemic states. At the endemic state, R=1. If you introduce some control at steady state that reduces R, e.g. by introducing a treatment that increases average rate of recovery, what do you expect happens to the disease? Will it go extinct? Try it in R. Figure out S/I/R at steady state. Then run the simulation with these values - in the absence of any intervention, the model should remain at steady state. Now introduce control by increasing rate of recovery, see what happens to the infected fraction.</p>&#13;
