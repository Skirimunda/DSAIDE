<h3>Task 1:</h3>&#13;
<ul><li>Set the model parameters such that it corresponds to the following setting:&#13;
<ul><li>A population size of 1000, 1 initially infected, presymptomatic host, simulation duration (approximately) 10 years.</li>&#13;
<li>Assume that only symptomatic individuals transmit, at rate <span class="math inline">\(b_I = 0.002\)</span>, and that there is no seasonal variation.</li>&#13;
<li>Assume that the duration of the symptomatic period is 1 month long. (Hint: The parameter <span class="math inline">\(g_i\)</span> is the inverse of this period. Also, the model parameters are in units of 1/month.)</li>&#13;
<li>Assume that the duration of the presymptomatic period is approximately 6 days long. (Hint: The parameter <span class="math inline">\(g_P\)</span> is the inverse of this period. Also, the model parameters are in units of 1/month. Make sure you convert correctly.)</li>&#13;
<li>Assume that there are no asymptomatic infections. You can therefore set the rate of recovery of asymptomatics, <span class="math inline">\(g_A\)</span> to anything, it doesn’t matter because nobody will be asymptomatic.</li>&#13;
<li>Assume nobody dies due to disease, and immunity does not wane.</li>&#13;
<li>Assume that there are no births and non-disease deaths occurring.</li>&#13;
</ul></li>&#13;
<li>With parameters set to correspond to the scenario just described, run the simulation and ensure you get a single outbreak.</li>&#13;
