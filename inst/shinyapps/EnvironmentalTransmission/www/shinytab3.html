<h2>What to do</h2>&#13;
<p><em>A general note: Some of the tasks below are fairly open ended. You shouldn’t go through the tasks like a check-list. Instead, explore these simulations, play with them, query them. As you do, loop through iterations of formulating your expectations for a specific scenario/task, running the model and observing results, and if results don’t agree with your expectations, figure out why. Essentially, <strong>“do science/research”</strong>.</em></p>&#13;
<div id="task-1" class="section level3">&#13;
<h3>Task 1:</h3>&#13;
<ul><li>Set the model parameters such that it corresponds to the following setting:&#13;
<ul><li>A population size of 1000, 1 initially infected host, simulation duration 10 years.</li>&#13;
<li>Consider density-dependent transmission, with a transmission rate of b<sub>d</sub> = 0.001, area of size 2.</li>&#13;
<li>Assume that the duration of the infectious period is 6 days long.</li>&#13;
<li>Turn off births, deaths and waning immunity for now.</li>&#13;
</ul></li>&#13;
<li>With parameters set to correspond to the scenario just described, run the simulation.</li>&#13;
<li>Record the number and fraction of susceptible/infected/recovered remaining at the end of the outbreak.</li>&#13;
</ul></div>&#13;
<div id="task-2" class="section level3">&#13;
<h3>Task 2:</h3>&#13;
<ul><li>Now switch to frequency-dependent transmission, set b<sub>f</sub>=0.5. Keep everything else as before.</li>&#13;
<li>Think about your expectations, run the simulation and compare your expectations with the results.</li>&#13;
<li>Anything surprising happening? Do you understand why you are seeing what you see?</li>&#13;
</ul></div>&#13;
<div id="task-6" class="section level3">&#13;
<h3>Task 6:</h3>&#13;
<ul><li>Keep exploring by trying different parameters and transmission settings and see how they influence results.</li>&#13;
<li>As you continue your exploration, think about potential real infectious diseases that might be approximated by either one of the transmission types, and what settings for other model parameters would be for those ID.</li>&#13;
</ul></div>&#13;
