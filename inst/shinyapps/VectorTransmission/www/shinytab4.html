<h2>Further Information</h2>&#13;
<ul><li>For this app, the underlying function running the simulation is called <code>simulate_vectortransmission.R</code>. You can call this function directly, without going through the shiny app. Check the help file for the function for more information. If you go that route, you need to use the results returned from this function and produce useful output (such as a plot) yourself.</li>&#13;
<li>You could also modify this R function for your own purposes.</li>&#13;
<li>To learn more about the underlying simulations and how to access and use the code, see the package vignette, which you can open by typing <code>vignette('DSAIDE')</code> in the R console.</li>&#13;
