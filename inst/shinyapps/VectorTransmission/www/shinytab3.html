<h2>What to do</h2>&#13;
<p><em>A general note: Some of the tasks below are fairly open ended. You shouldn’t go through the tasks like a check-list. Instead, explore these simulations, play with them, query them. As you do, loop through iterations of formulating your expectations for a specific scenario/task, running the model and observing results, and if results don’t agree with your expectations, figure out why. Essentially, <strong>“do science/research”</strong>.</em></p>&#13;
<div id="task-1" class="section level3">&#13;
<h3>Task 1:</h3>&#13;
<ul><li>Set the model parameters such that it corresponds to the following setting:&#13;
<ul><li>A population size of 1000, 1 initially infected host, no pathogen in environment, simulation duration 10 years.</li>&#13;
<li>We’ll first look at direct transmission. Set transmission rate of <em>b<sub>d</sub> = 0.001</em>, environmental transmission to 0.</li>&#13;
<li>Set environmental pathogen shedding and clearance to 0.</li>&#13;
<li>Assume that the duration of the infectious period is half a month (about 2 weeks) long.</li>&#13;
<li>Turn off births and deaths for now.</li>&#13;
</ul></li>&#13;
<li>Run the simulation. You should get the usual direct transmission outbreak and SIR dynamics.</li>&#13;
<li>Record the number and fraction of susceptible/infected/recovered remaining at the end of the outbreak.</li>&#13;
</ul></div>&#13;
<div id="task-2" class="section level3">&#13;
<h3>Task 2:</h3>&#13;
<ul><li>Now try various values for the rate of shedding into the environment and environmental clearance.</li>&#13;
<li>As you change those parameters away from 0 (but don’t change anything else), what do you expect to see?</li>&#13;
<li>Think about your expectations, run the simulation and compare your expectations with the results.</li>&#13;
<li>Anything surprising happening? Do you understand why you are seeing what you see?</li>&#13;
</ul></div>&#13;
