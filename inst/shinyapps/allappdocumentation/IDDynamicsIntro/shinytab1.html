<h2>Overview</h2>&#13;
<p>For this module, we will do a first exploration of an infectious disease simulation. The main goal is to get you familiar with the overall setup and ideas behind using these simulations, and how to run them. Read about the model in the “Model” tab. Then do the tasks described in the “What to do” tab.</p>&#13;
<p><strong>Keep a record for the results you obtain doing the tasks described below. The online quiz covering the practice part will ask for (some of) these results/answers.</strong></p>&#13;
