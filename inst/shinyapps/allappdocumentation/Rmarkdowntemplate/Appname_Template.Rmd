```{r}
#Creating an R chunck provides an easy way to add comments in R style - a bit trickier in Markdown itself
#The extra settings in the YAML header that are uncommented allow for styling of the app
#that's not needed, the template here without the extra information should work
#use this template and fill it with information for your App
#turn this into an HTML file using RMarkdown (knitr/pandoc)
#make sure the HTML file is in the directory with all the App documentation, then run the processing script on it
#if everything works, the information described below should automatically be displayed in tabs at the bottom of the App UI
```

##Overview {#shinytab1}
Everything inside sections called shinytab will be processed by the R script and placed in separate tabs at the bottom of the shiny UI. Anything not in such a section will be ignored.
The general structure and headings are as given here.

In this tab, provide a quick overview and most important information.

##The Model {#shinytab2}

###Model Overview
Describe the model underlying the App.

###Model Implementation
Could have an extra section here showing flow diagram and equations, if applicable.


##What to do {#shinytab3}

###Task 1: 
* Describe the different tasks a user should do

###Task 2: 
* Another task to be done


##Answers 
This section does not have the shinytab label and is therefore ignored and not included in the app. One could provide the answers here. Note that if this file is supplied with the package, the answers are in principle available, so most users might not know where/how to look.

###Answer 1: 
Answer to task 1.

##Further Information {#shinytab4}
* This gives information for anyone wanting to dig deeper. 
* Could be list of references, or explanation on how to access the underlying code, etc.

##More sections
Any other sections that don't have the shinytab label can be included here but are ignored by the processing script and not included in the app UI.
