#' Simulation of a compartmental infectious disease transmission model illustrating different types of transmission
#'
#' @description  This model allows for the simulation of different transmission modes
#' 
#'
#' @param PopSize try a range of values for this and see how it affects the outbreak - this corresponds to the "initial-population" slider in NetLogo
#' @param I0 initial number of infected hosts, again try a number of different values - this corresponds to the "initial-infected" slider in NetLogo
#' @param R0 initial number of recovered hosts - for now we assume there are no recovered (immune) hosts. We get to this in the course.
#' @param tmax maximum simulation time, units of years, (equivalent to Max-time slider in the NetLogo simulation)
#' @param gamma rate at which a person leaves the infectious compartment, which is the inverse of the average duration of the infections period. Note: 1/gamma is the duration of the infectious period in units of YEARS so e.g. gamma=26 means infectious period = 1/26 years = 14 days
#' @param beta.d rate of transmission of pathogen from infected to susceptible host (density)
#' @param beta.f rate of transmission of pathogen from infected to susceptible host (frequency)
#' @param mu death rate parameter - inverse, i.e. 1/mu, is the average lifespan (in years), a value of 0 means no deaths. A value of 1/20 means e.g. 20 years lifespan
#' @param w duration of immunity. Setting it to zero means infinite immunity (no waning immunity), 1/w is duration of immunity, so e.g. w=0.5 means 2 years of immunity
#' @param k constant of proportionality for population-size dependent area - choose such that results look decent
#' @param scenario set to different values for different stransmission scenarios: 1 = density-dependent, 2 = frequency-dependent
#' @return This function returns the simulation result as obtained from a call
#'   to the deSolve ode solver
#' @details A compartmental ID model with several states/compartments
#'   is simulated as a set of ordinary differential
#'   equations. The function returns the output from the odesolver as a matrix,
#'   with one column per compartment/variable. The first column is time.
#' @section Warning:
#'   This function does not perform any error checking. So if you try to do
#'   something nonsensical (e.g. have I0 > PopSize or any negative values or fractions > 1),
#'   the code will likely abort with an error message
#' @examples
#'   # To run the simulation with default parameters just call this function
#'   result <- simulate_transmissionmodes()
#'   # To choose parameter values other than the standard one, specify them e.g. like such
#'   result <- simulate_transmissionmodes(PopSize = 2000, P0 = 10, tmax = 100 )
#'   # You should then use the simulation result returned from the function, e.g. like this:
#'   plot(result[,1],result[,2],xlab='Time',ylab='Number Susceptible',type='l')
#' @seealso The UI of the shiny app 'TransmissionModes', which is part of this package, contains more details on the model
#' @author Andreas Handel
#' @references We can add (a) reference(s) here..
