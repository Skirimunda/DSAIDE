#' Simulation of a compartmental infectious disease transmission model illustrating different types of transmission
#'
#' @description  This model allows for the simulation of different transmission modes
#' 
#'
#' @param S0 initial number of susceptible hosts
#' @param I0 initial number of infected hosts
#' @param Sv0 initial number of susceptible vectors
#' @param tmax maximum simulation time, units of months
#' @param beta1 rate of transmission from infected to susceptible host
#' @param beta2 rate of transmission from infected vector to susceptible host
#' @param beta3 rate of transmission from environment to susceptible host
#' @param beta4 rate of transmission from infected host to susceptible vector
#' @param lambda1 the rate of births of hosts
#' @param lambda2 the rate of births of vectors
#' @param n1 the rate of natural death of hosts
#' @param n2 the rate of natural death of vectors
#' @param gamma1 the rate at which infected hosts recover/die
#' @param gamma2 the rate at which infected vectors recover/die
#' @param p the rate at which infected host shed pathogen in the enviroment
#' @param c the rate at which pathogen in the enviroment decays
#' @return This function returns the simulation result as obtained from a call
#'   to the deSolve ode solver
#' @details A compartmental ID model with several states/compartments
#'   is simulated as a set of ordinary differential
#'   equations. The function returns the output from the odesolver as a matrix,
#'   with one column per compartment/variable. The first column is time.
#' @section Warning:
#'   This function does not perform any error checking. So if you try to do
#'   something nonsensical (e.g. any negative values or fractions > 1),
#'   the code will likely abort with an error message
#' @examples
#' @examples
#'   # To run the simulation with default parameters just call this function
#'   result <- simulate_transmissionmodes()
#'   # To choose parameter values other than the standard one, specify them e.g. like such
#'   result <- simulate_transmissionmodes(S0 = 100, Sv0 = 1e5,  tmax = 100)
#'   # You should then use the simulation result returned from the function, e.g. like this:
#'   plot(result[,1],result[,2],xlab='Time',ylab='Number Susceptible',type='l')
#' @seealso The UI of the shiny app 'TransmissionModes', which is part of this package, contains more details on the model
