#' @title A helper function that takes result from the simulators and produces text output
#'
#' @description This function generates text to be displayed in the Shiny UI.
#' This is a helper function. This function processes results returned from the simulation, supplied as a list
#' @param res a list structure containing all simulation results that are to be processed
#'    this function is meant to be used together with generate_plots and requires similar information
#'    the length of the list indicates the number of separate plots to make, and for each plot this function produces text
#'    each list entry needs to contain the following information/elements:
#'    1. a data frame called "dat" with one column called xvals, one column yvals,
#'    one column called varnames that contains names for different variables.
#'    varnames needs to be a factor variable or will be converted to one.
#'    Optional, one column called IDvar for further grouping (i.e. multiple lines for stochastic simulations).
#'    If plottype is 'mixedplot' an additional column called 'style' indicating line or point plot
#'    for each variable is needed.
#'    For stochastic simulations that require averaging, an variable called nreps is needed,
#'    which should indicate the number of simulation.
#'    2. meta-data for the plot, provided in the following variables:
#'    optinal: plottype - one of "Lineplot" (chosen if nothing is provided),"Scatterplot","Boxplot", "Mixedplot"
#'    the plottype determines what kind of text is generated.
#'    For lineplots and mixedplot, min/max/final values of each line are shown
#'    for scatterplots, a correlation coefficient is computed
#'    boxplots show min/max/median/average
#'    if the list entry 'maketext' is set to TRUE (or not provided) exists for a given plot the just described outputs will be generated.
#'    If 'maketext' is FALSE, no text is generated.
#'    If present' the entries 'showtext'
#'    for each plot and finaltext of the 1st list element for an overall message/text
#'    are also shown.
#' @return HTML formatted text for display in a shiny UI
#' @details This function is called by the shiny server to produce output returned to the shiny UI
