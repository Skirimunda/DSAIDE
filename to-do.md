## To-do list for DSAIDE package


* Fix non-displaying of equations when using Rstudio viewer

* Add a 'simulation in progress' message that shows up after submit button is hit while simulation runs

* Improve plot displays

* Continue streamlining code base to make it more general/modular/flexible


Add following content/features to package:
* make figures, their look, size and placement better

* Add a 'simulation running' message. This message should go away as soon as the simulation has finished and output has been displayed. Depending on how many lines of code this is, maybe turn it into a stand-alone function. But only do that if it doesn't make the code more complex.

* Left or block align text on main menu page

Note: I found a good source of shiny examples and tips and tricks that might be helpful. 
E.g. the ""Busy..." / "Done!" / "Error" example on that website might be useful for the progress bar task below.
