#Abstract



#Introduction
A hallmark of infectious diseases is the interaction and feedback provided by pathogens and hosts during the transmission process. As such, classic epidemiological approaches based on study designs assuming inidependence are somewhat limited. 
It has long been realized that systems approaches based on modeling are useful to study complex systems such as infectious diseases [@blower04]
