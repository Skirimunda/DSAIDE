Things that need doing, in order of importance:


Soon:
1. Finish vignette, check manual/documentation, improve as needed. 


Starting January:
2. Have someone (John Rossow), go through the whole package, try it and fix/flag things
    * Test for bugs in code
    * Test for errors/unclear things in built-in/app documentation
    * Check R documentation, flag any unclear things
    * Test vignette

3. Post package to CRAN, publicize
4. Write DSAIDE paper
5. Write and publish DSAIDE book. Use bookdown, place on leanpub. Then decide if going with a real publisher makes sense.
