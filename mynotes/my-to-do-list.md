Things that need doing, in order of importance:


Soon:
1. Finish vignette, check manual/documentation, improve as needed. 

Starting January:
2. Have someone (John Rossow), go through the whole package, try it and fix/flag things
3. Post package to CRAN, publicize


4. Write DSAIDE paper

5. Write and publish DSAIDE book. Use bookdown, place on leanpub. Then decide if going with a real publisher makes sense.
