- Make the main menu graphical. Ideally, make it a Shiny app, where the UI has a bunch of buttons, each for a different App. Once the user klicks a button, the Menu App should somehow 'shut down' and start the App for the chosen simulation. When the user exits the specific simulation App, the Menu App will come back. (Later, we can add some welcome, contact/disclaimer and other explanatory text to the menu App.)

- Remove progress bar. Instead, once a user hits 'run simulation' a 'simulation running' message should show up below the button. This message should go away as soon as the simulation has finished and output has been displayed. For now, only try it on the "IDPatterns" app, leave others as they are.
