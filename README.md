# DSAIDE
R Package - Dynamical Systems Approach to Infectious Disease Epidemiology


## Description
This is an R package consisting of a set of Shiny Apps to teach infectious disease epidemiology.
By manipulating the models and working through the instructions provided within the shiny UI, you can learn about some important concepts in infectious disease epidemiology. 
You will also learn how models can be used to study such concepts.

##Basic Use
After loading the package, run `dsaidemenu()` to start the main menu. 
From there choose the different apps corresponding to different infectious disease topics and scenarios.
Each app contains a description of the model and scenario that is implemented.
Each app also contains a list of recommeded tasks to work through in order to learn about a specific infectious topic.

##Advanced Use
The vignette illustrates ways to interact with and modify the underlying models without the use of the Shiny GUI.
